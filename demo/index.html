		<h1>Ice Demo</h1>
	
		<p>
			Ice is a track changes implementation, built in javascript, for anything that is contenteditable on the web. The following are demos of Ice in action. You can check out the code on <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/ice">github</a>.
		</p>
		<h3>Contenteditable</h3>
		<p>
			With some text editing management of your own, Ice can be initialized on any element that is contenteditable. The following is a makeshift editor, made out of a `div` element container and some `p` root blocks. The editor buttons use Ice's API to change the user being tracked and toggle the visibility of changes.

		<h3>Tinymce Plugin</h3>
		<p>
			With tinymce handling the text editing, Ice can initialize and operate in a more configurable editing environment. Notice, the last six buttons in the toolbar can be toggled to modify changes or the state of Ice. In addition, this example shows off the ease in customizing and plugging in styles for tracking tags with a highlighter style contributed by Andrew Ozz at Wordpress. Since Andrew's style only uses two colors, one for inserts and one for deletes, you can hover over changes to get a title popup with more information about the user for a change.
