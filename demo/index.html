		<h1>Ice Demo</h1>
	
		<p>
			Ice is a track changes implementation, built in javascript, for anything that is contenteditable on the web. The following are demos of Ice in action. You can check out the code on <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/ice">github</a>.
		</p>
		<h3>Contenteditable</h3>
		<p>
			With some text editing management of your own, Ice can be initialized on any element that is contenteditable. The following is a makeshift editor, made out of a `div` element container and some `p` root blocks. The editor buttons use Ice's API to change the user being tracked and toggle the visibility of changes.

They are clustered not just in New York and Los Angeles, but also in Denver and Dallas. The range of wealth in the 1 percent is vast &mdash; from households that bring in $380,000 a year, according to census data, up to billionaires like Warren E. Buffett and Bill Gates.</p><p>The top 1 percent of earners in a given year receives <a title="Related data from the Tax Policy Center." href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?DocID=2972">just under a fifth</a> of the country's pretax income, <a title="A Congressional Budget Office report." href="http://www.cbo.gov/publications/collections/tax/2010/pre-tax_income_shares.pdf">about double their share</a> 30 years ago. They pay just over a fourth of all federal taxes, according to the Tax Policy Center. In 2007, they accounted for about 30 percent of philanthropic giving, according to Federal Reserve data. They received 22 percent of their income from capital gains, compared with 2 percent for everybody else.</p><p><insert class="ins cts-3" data-cid="21" data-userid="11" data-username="Geoffrey Jellineck" data-time="1326764626633" title="Inserted by Geoffrey Jellineck - 01/16/2012 8:43pm">Still, they are not necessarily the idle rich. Mr. Katz, who sometimes commutes by amphibious plane and sometimes carries luggage for Talon Air passengers, likes to say he works "26/9."</insert></p> <p>Most 1 percenters were born with socioeconomic advantages, which helps explain why the 1 percent is more likely than other Americans to have jobs, according to census data. They work longer hours, being three times more likely than the 99 percent to work more than 50 hours a week, and are more likely to be self-employed. Married 1 percenters are just as likely as other couples to have two incomes, but men are the big breadwinners, earning 75 percent of the money, compared with 64 percent of the income in other households.</p><p>Though many of the wealthy lean toward the Republican Party, in interviews, 1 percenters expressed a broad range of views on how to fix the economy. They think that President Obama is ruining it, or that Republicans in Congress have gone off the deep end. They favor a flat tax, or they believe the rich should pay a higher marginal rate. Some cheered on Occupy Wall Street, saying it was about time, while others wished the protesters would just get a job or take a bath. Still others were philosophical &mdash; perhaps because they could afford to be &mdash; viewing the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/r/recession_and_depression/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about the recession." class="meta-classifier">recession</a> as something that would pass, like so many previous ups and downs.</p><p><insert class="ins cts-2" data-cid="31" data-userid="22" data-username="Chuck Noblet" data-time="1326765165952" title="Inserted by Chuck Noblet - 01/16/2012 8:52pm">Of the 1 percenters interviewed for this article, almost all &amp;mdash; conservatives and liberals alike &amp;mdash; said the wealthy could and should shoulder more of the country's financial burden, and almost all said they viewed the current system as unfair. But they may prefer facing cuts to their own benefits like &lt;a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/social_security_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about Social Security." class="meta-classifier"&gt;Social Security&lt;/a&gt; than paying more taxes.

I don't mind putting money to programs that help the poor," said Anthony J. Bonomo of Manhasset, N.Y., who runs a medical malpractice insurance company and is a Republican. But, he said, he did mind taking a hit for the country's woes. "If those people could camp out in that park all day, why aren't they out looking for a job? Why are they blaming others?"</p><p>To many, 99 vs. 1 was an artificial distinction that overlooked hard work and moral character. "It shouldn't be relevant," said Mr. Katz , who said he both creates job and contributes to charitable causes. "I'm not hurting anyone. I'm helping a lot of people."</p><p><strong> The Enclave</strong></p><p>The placid sliver of Long Island that F. Scott Fitzgerald immortalized in "The Great Gatsby" as West Egg and East Egg seems almost to have shrugged off the recession.</p><p>A stretch of northwest Nassau County that includes Great Neck, Manhasset and Port Washington, this area has the country's highest concentration of 1 percenters, and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the state. Houses in Port Washington are worth only 10 percent less than they were at their peak, according to the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/standard_poors_caseshiller_home_price_index/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about the Case-Shiller Home Price Index." class="meta-classifier">Standard &amp; Poor's Case-Shiller Home Price Index</a>, a far smaller decline than in the rest of the country.

		<h3>Tinymce Plugin</h3>
		<p>
			With tinymce handling the text editing, Ice can initialize and operate in a more configurable editing environment. Notice, the last six buttons in the toolbar can be toggled to modify changes or the state of Ice. In addition, this example shows off the ease in customizing and plugging in styles for tracking tags with a highlighter style contributed by Andrew Ozz at Wordpress. Since Andrew's style only uses two colors, one for inserts and one for deletes, you can hover over changes to get a title popup with more information about the user for a change.
